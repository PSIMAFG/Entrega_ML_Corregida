    "## 3. Introducción\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Contexto\n",
    "El Programa de Salud Mental registra egresos por **alta** o **abandono**. Anticipar el riesgo de abandono permite **priorizar acciones de rescate** y de **gestión clínica** para prevenirlo. La base `BDEGRESO.xlsx` (datos simulados basados en 2020–2023) contiene variables administrativas y clínicas (p. ej., `SEXO`, `GRUPO_ETARIO_MIN`, diagnósticos, tipo de profesional de última atención) y **fechas clave** (ingreso, egreso, última atención, rescate), a partir de las cuales derivamos **indicadores temporales** asociados a la permanencia en el programa.  \n",
    "El principal reto es el **desbalance de clases** (**abandono ≈ 80%**, **alta ≈ 20%**) y el **tamaño muestral moderado**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Objetivo del modelo\n",
    "Construir un **clasificador binario** que estime la probabilidad de **abandono (1)** vs **alta (0)** al egreso, **maximizando la detección de abandonos** sin penalizar en exceso las **altas** (clase minoritaria). Operativamente, el **ajuste de umbral** buscará cumplir:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensibilidad (TPR) para Abandono ≥ 0.90**  *(≥ 90% de abandonos reconocidos)*  \n",
    "- **Especificidad (TNR) para Altas ≥ 0.50**  *(≥ 50% de altas correctamente identificadas)*  \n",
    "*(cuando sea factible según los datos).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Esta medida se adoptó porque en pruebas iniciales se observó **overfitting** hacia la clase *abandono*, con un número elevado de **falsos positivos** que diluía la utilidad de la alerta. Por ello se buscó el **mejor equilibrio** posible entre **falsos negativos** y **falsos positivos** según distintas métricas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Para robustez:**\n",
    "- Se comparan rendimientos de **Random Forest**, **XGBoost (GPU)**, **LightGBM (GPU)**, **CatBoost (GPU)**, **Regresión Logística** y **SVM**.  \n",
    "- Se emplea **validación cruzada estratificada** y **tuning de umbral por *fold***.  \n",
    "- Las métricas foco son **Balanced Accuracy (BA)** y **MCC**, junto a **ROC-AUC** y **PR-AUC**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Alcance del reporte\n",
    "El análisis cubre:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocesamiento de datos:** limpieza, normalización de textos, codificación categórica (dummies `DX_*`, `PROF_*`), derivación de `PERMANENCIA_DIAS` y `DIAS_ULT_ATENCION_A_RESCATE` a partir de fechas, y **controles de calidad** (p. ej., permanencia negativa).  \n",
    "- **Definición del *target*** desde `OBS._ESTADISTICAS` (**alta vs abandono**) y **manejo del desbalance** (ponderación de clases y/o ajuste de umbral).  \n",
    "- **Comparación de modelos** con **validación cruzada** (GPU donde aplique), incluyendo **ajuste de umbral guiado por metas** y **resumen de métricas**.  \n",
    "- **Selección del modelo/umbral** basada en **BA** y **MCC** con rendimientos esperados; **reporte de importancias/coeficientes** para su interpretación.  \n",
    "- **Pipeline de inferencia:** alineación de columnas, transformaciones necesarias (**Yeo-Johnson + estandarización** para modelos lineales como RL).\n",
    "- **Limitaciones y riesgos:** tamaño muestral, estabilidad de métricas en la clase minoritaria (altas), potenciales sesgos y pasos propuestos para mejora futura (nuevas *features* temporales y de adherencia).\n"

    "- En cada fold calcula probabilidades, **sintoniza el umbral** para metas (TPR≥0.90, TNR≥0.50 si es posible) y resume métricas: **BA, MCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, ACC, PREC, TPR, TNR** \n",

    "# Conclusiones preliminares del modelo\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Resultado global\n",
    "XGB en GPU fue el que mejor rindió en validación cruzada (BA ~0.70; MCC ~0.46) y mantuvo buen desempeño en test (ROC-AUC ~0.80; PR-AUC ~0.95).  \n",
    "Con umbral 0.5 logra una sensibilidad alta (detecta la mayoría de los abandonos) pero la especificidad es baja (TNR ~22–33%), por lo que entrega bastantes falsos positivos aún.  \n",
    "Bajar el umbral apenas mejora la TPR y empeora la TNR, por lo que no conviene sin una restricción explícita de TNR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Variables con mayor influencia (visión actual)\n",
    "- HUBO_RESCATE: señales de mayor riesgo cuando hubo rescates previos.\n",
    "- DIAS_ULT_ATENCION_A_RESCATE: latencias más largas se asocian a mayor probabilidad de abandono.\n",
    "- PERMANENCIA_DIAS: efecto inverso más débil; mayor permanencia real se asocia con menor abandono.\n",
    "- SEXO y GRUPO_ETARIO_MIN muestran poca señal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Aprendizajes sobre data leakage\n",
    "El problema inicial fue usar información ligada al egreso (que define la etiqueta) para construir variables.  \n",
    "Se corrigió:\n",
    "- PERMANENCIA_DIAS = última atención – ingreso  \n",
    "- DIAS_ULT_ATENCION_A_RESCATE = rescate – última atención  \n",
    "Con esto disminuyó el sobreajuste y el desempeño generaliza algo mejor (la caída de validación cruzada a test es moderada).  \n",
    "Además, las transformaciones que aprenden parámetros (imputación, transformaciones y escalado) se ajustan solo en train y por fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implicancias operativas\n",
    "El modelo actual sirve para priorizar rescates porque detecta muchos abandonos, pero genera falsos positivos en altas.  \n",
    "Conviene ajustar hiperparámetros y umbral con una TNR mínima operativa (por ejemplo, 0.35–0.45 según capacidad de respuesta), y considerar calibrar probabilidades.  \n",
    "Otra opción podría ser trabajar con cupos (top-k) según recursos disponibles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Notas de rendimiento (GPU)\n",
    "Ejecutar en GPU redujo tiempos de >1 hora a menos de 15 minutos en pruebas largas.  \n",
    "Esto permitió iterar más rápido y observar cuellos de botella en el diseño del script. Mantener un preprocesamiento simple ayuda a estabilizar los tiempos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Próximo paso\n",
    "Tuning focalizado de XGB (scale_pos_weight, profundidad, min_child_weight, gamma, subsample/colsample), búsqueda de umbral con TNR mínima y calibración (sigmoid o isotónica).  \n",
    "Luego, comparar nuevamente BA, MCC, AUC y matrices de confusión frente a la versión actual.\n"
